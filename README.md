# DxClub Cybersecurity Challenge
This DxClub Cybersecurity Challenge was a part of numerous routine challenges the club would do during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.  
The goal of this challenge is to not only teach members about the fundamentals of cryptography but to also learn it in a fun way! Most of this code was made by Luis Plascencia, any code taken from outside sources will be linked in a comment next to its corresponding place!  

This challenge took place on February 3, 2021.
